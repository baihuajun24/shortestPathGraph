# shortestPathGraph
This is a project for practice when I took Networks and Markets [CS5854](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5854/2017fa/). In this project, I implemented BFS to find shortest path. Then I analyzed data from Facebook [Social circles: Facebook](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html) and concluded average distance between two people is 3.6 in their data. You can find a complete problem description [here](https://github.com/baihuajun24/shortestPathGraph/blob/master/hw1-2017.pdf) and my report [here](https://github.com/baihuajun24/shortestPathGraph/blob/master/hw1merged.pdf).
